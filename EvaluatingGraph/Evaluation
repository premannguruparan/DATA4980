   - Categorical (Product 1, 2, 3)  
3. Tasks:  
   - Analyze trend, sales proportions over months   
4. Graph: A graph is needed a stacked area or line chart would show trends.  
5. Encoding:  
   - ""  
6. Variable Placement: Months (x-axis), proportions (y-axis), products (color/legend) 
7. Elements:

Evaluation of "CO2 Emissions" Graph  
1. Intended User: Environmental policymakers or researchers comparing national emission contributions.  
2. Data Types:  
   - Categorical (countries).  
   - Quantitative (percentages).  
3. Tasks:  
   - {Compare, emission percentages across countries}.  
   - {Identify, top contributors}.  
4. Graph: A bar chart is suitable for comparing discrete values. A pie chart would be misleading (total ≠ 100%).  
5. Encoding:  
   - Bar length for percentages.  
   - Color for country distinction.  
6. Variable Placement: Countries on x-axis, percentages on y-axis.  
7. Elements:  
   - Check if percentages are absolute or relative (current total exceeds 100%, so clarify data context).  
   - Label countries directly or use a legend.  
   - Gridlines/tick marks should reflect accurate scaling (e.g., 0–35%).  
8. Featured Data: Emphasize top emitters (China, US). Clarify if percentages represent global totals or a subset.
